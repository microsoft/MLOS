# A Dockerfile for creating a suitable (Linux) build environment for MLOS for
# development and testing on the various versions of Ubuntu we need to support.

# Supported UbuntuVersions: 16.04, 18.04, 20.04
#
# Do a minimal build with:
#   UbuntuVersion=20.04;
#   docker build . --target mlos-build-base-without-extras \
#       --build-arg=UbuntuVersion=$UbuntuVersion \
#       -t mlos-build-ubuntu-$UbuntuVersion \
#       --cache-from ghcr.io/microsoft-cisl/mlos/mlos-build-ubuntu-$UbuntuVersion
#
# Note: to optionally reference a local proxy cache, also add the following argument:
#       --build-arg=http_proxy=http://some-proxy-host:3128
#
# Run with:
#   docker run -it -v $PWD:/src/MLOS -P --name mlos-build mlos-build-ubuntu-$UbuntuVersion
#
# This allows live editing in a native editor (e.g. VSCode or
# VisualStudio) and building using the container's environment.
#
# Alternatively, change the --target option in the command above to
# "mlos-build-base-with-source" to include the current source tree in the image
# and then omit the "-v" option arguments in the "docker run" command.
#
# To restart an existing container:
#   docker start -i mlos-build
#
# Once inside the container the `make` command will handle typical build needs.
# See the markdown files in the documentation/ directory for additional information.

# The default version of Ubuntu to use.
# This is currently set to 16.04 since that is the version that SqlServer
# supports.  See above for ways to override this.
ARG UbuntuVersion=16.04

# Allow requesting an image with additional content useful for interactive
# development by passing --build-arg=MlosBuildBaseArg=with-extras
ARG MlosBuildBaseArg=without-extras

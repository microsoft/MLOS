class ParetoFrontier:
    """Maintains a set of non-dominated configurations.

    This class will have several pieces of functionality:
        1. It will be able to construct and maintain a pareto frontier from a set of observations for one or more objectives.
        2. It will be able to update the frontier upon receiving a new observation.
        3. It will be able to decide whether any given point is dominated or not (needed for Monte Carlo utility functions).

    Each point will be characterized by:
        1. Configuration parameters
        2. Objective function values
        3. Possibly context values

    A point belongs to a pareto frontier if it is not dominated by any other point. So if two points have the exact same values
    for all objectives (but possibly different configurations), we will consider both of them to be pareto efficient.

        We do this by consecutively removing points on the interior of the pareto frontier from objectives_df until none are left.

        We retain the points that fall onto the frontier line, for the following reasons:
            1. The code is more efficient.
            2. If they were jiggled only a little bit outwards they would be included.
            3. In real life we expect it to be an extremely rare occurrence.

        We retain duplicated points because they could be due to different configurations.

      With multiple SettingsProviders generated for a large project, we may need to name them differently for disambiguation.
      This path property is expected to be set by the including project referencing this package.
      On the C++ consumer side, it is also the path to add to the cmake target_include_directories().
      We recommend using a BaseDir path combined with the ProjectName for this path.

      TODO: Add a reasonable default here.  Maybe something in the source tree? (*yuck*)

      (Making this a common output directory can make it easier to interact with the Mlos.Agent.Server, for instance)

    "## Optimizer evaluation purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of optimizer evaluation is to learn how to best match an optimizer configuration to an optimization problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optimizer evaluation strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly, the optimizer evaluation strategy hinges on characterizing the optimizers' performance on a variety of optimization problems, under a variety of configurations. This should allow us to:\n",
    "* find the strengths and limitations of the various optimizer configurations,\n",
    "* discard the dominated configurations,\n",
    "* ultimately match optimizer configurations with the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: No absolute scale of optimzier performance seems to have garnered consensus in the community. Thus, in this exercise we will compare the optimizers with each other. We can also compare them to some published results, though it might be good to replicate them first.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common way to compare multiple optimizers is to rank them for each problem given a particular budget (usually in terms of number of evaluations, though if we assume that the function is cheap to compute, optimizer resource consumption might be more relevant). Then we can report average rank across problems to compare the optimizers. Or we can do a matrix for each benchmark problem which optimizer dominates which.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimizer performance characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to evaluate the following aspects of the optimizers' performance:\n",
    "* convergence - is the optimizer finding the optima, More formally, can the optimizer get within epsilon of the known optimum at all?\n",
    "* rate of convergence - how quickly is the optimizer finding the optima?\n",
    "* trajectory of convergence - is the optimizer improving rapidly at first, and then reaching a plateau, is it climbing steadily, or does it stagnate for a long time, before finally shooting up?\n",
    "* surrogate model goodness of fit - how well do the models fit the training data, validation data (out of bag samples), test data (observations gathered after the model was fit), random test data (random observations gathered after the model was fit). \n",
    "* computational cost - for now we can use the Tracer to capture runtime information, down the road we should monitor CPU, and memory utilization too.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What to measure\n",
    "\n",
    "* Convergence of the entire optimizer on synthetic and real data.\n",
    "* Models' goodness of fit on synthetic and real data, in both on both guided and unguided observations.\n",
    "* Utility function optimizers' performance on synthetic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We shall measure and plot all of the above metrics as a function of the number of observations that the optimzier has been fit on.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Definition of optimum\n",
    "Various definitions of optimum are possible, and we have built consensus that the user should choose a definition suitable for their purpose. Here are some options:\n",
    "1. Best observation - simplest, but can be deceptive in presence of noise. \n",
    "2. Observations with the highest:\n",
    "    1. predicted mean performance\n",
    "    2. upper confidence bound on performance\n",
    "    3. lower confidence bound on performance\n",
    "3. Speculative optima - return configurations predicted by the surrogate model but not necessarily tested:\n",
    "    1. maximum predicted mean\n",
    "    2. maximum predicted upper confidence bound\n",
    "    3. maximum predicted lower confidence bound\n",
    "        \n",
    "Once we graduate to multi-objective optimization, we will need to build pareto frontiers from the above.\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, that surrogate models' goodness of fit becomes very important for all but the first definition of optimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selecting the optimizer configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability of an optimizer to converge on an optimum is our fundamental requirement. From between the optimizers that can converge we can break ties using secondary criteria: rate of convergence, goodness of fit, computational complexity of the optimizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Troubleshooting the optimizers\n",
    "\n",
    "For the optimizers that do not converge, this framework should illuminate their modes of failure:\n",
    "* Is the model not fitting the data well?\n",
    "* Is the model fitting the data, but the exposed parameters don't affect performance, or is there too much noise?\n",
    "* If the model has strong goodness of fit, and performance is sensitive to the parameters, is the utility function optimizer up to the job? \n",
    "* Are we using the right utility function?"

# Mlos.Core Documentation

The `Mlos.Core` library's primary purpose is to provide shared memory
communication channel abstractions for the target application to communicate
with the external agent (`Mlos.Agent.Server`) to register and expose its
components' settings, their telemetry messages, and their feedback callback
actions for tuning them.

## Description

`mlos-bench` is an end-to-end benchmarking service that can be independently launched for experimentation but is also integrated with `mlos-core` as its optimizer for OS tuning.
 Given a user-provided VM configuration, `mlos-bench` provisions a configured environment and remotely executes benchmarks on the cloud.
 Experiment results (benchmark results & telemetry) are stored as input to the `mlos-core` optimization engine loop to evaluate proposed configuration parameters and produce new results.

## Features

With a [JSON5](https://spec.json5.org) config file and command line parameters as input, `mlos-bench` streamlines workload performance measurement by automating the following benchmarking steps:

1. Set up & clean up benchmark and application configuration
    - **Ease of use:** Mlos-bench abstracts away controls for managing VMs in Azure, e.g., setup, teardown, stop, deprovision, and reboot. Get visibility into VM status through Azure Portal, ensuring that a VM is provisioned & running before issuing commands to it.
    - **Versatility:** Mlos-bench provides a common interface to control a collection of environments (application, OS, VM), regardless of where or which cloud they come from. This allows changes to easily propagate to all environment layers when a new set of kernel parameters are applied.
    - **Efficiency:** In adapting an environment to new parameters, mlos-bench optimizes for low re-configuration costs during optimization. For example, considering that not all OS kernel parameter adjustments require a full reboot, as some can be changed during run-time.
2. Run benchmarks in the provisioned environment & standardize results for the optimizer
    - Through Azure File Share, access docker scripts to run benchmarks & store results as input for optimization. For example, execute Redis benchmark uploaded to the file share, running a benchmark docker container with specified parameters. The file share is mounted to VMs via remote execution, instead of ARM templates.
    - **Configurable:** Specify a python script in the initial config to post-process & standardize benchmark results. An example post-processing script for Redis benchmarks is included.
    - **Local & remote benchmark execution:** Benchmarks can be run both locally in Hyper-V and remotely on Azure. Local execution allows better accuracy, while Azure runs are required to estimate the benchmark noise and understand the VM behavior when using cloud storage.
    - **Cloud agnostic:** Mlos-bench can remotely execute benchmarks on other clouds, outside of Azure - e.g., controls for EC2 instances and ability to provision environments on AWS with Terraform.
    - **Persistence:** Storage integration is available to persist experiment parameters and track results for re-use, either for analysis during & after trials, or warm-starting future experiments.

## Quickstart

To get started, we can adapt an example configuration to test out running `mlos-bench`.
For these instructions, we will be using Azure for our resources.

1. Make sure that you have Azure CLI tool installed and working.

    > Installation instructions for `az` (Azure CLI) [can be found here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

    If necessary, login to Azure and set your default subscription:

    ```powershell
    # If using az cli for the first time, a login will be required:
    az login
    # Make sure that GSL subscription is your default:
    az account set --subscription "..."
    ```

2. Generate access tokens to interact with Azure resources.

    A script at `./scripts/generate-azure-credentials-config.ps1` produces a JSON with Azure credentials.
    This data is in the format that can be used by our framework.

    ```powershell
    # If using for the az cli first time, a login will be required
    ./scripts/generate-azure-credentials-config.ps1 > ./global_config.json
    ```

    On Linux, use `./scripts/generate-azure-credentials-config.sh` (requires `az` and `jq` to be installed).

3. Copy the sample config tree from `mlos_bench/config` to another folder of your choice, e.g.,

    ```sh
    cp -R mlos_bench/config ./my-config
    ```

4. Modify the service configuration files at `my-config/azure/service-*.jsonc` with your Azure setup data.
E.g., in `my-config/azure/service-provision-vm.jsonc`, put your target resource group information, as well as desired VM name, denoted in `{{ ... }}` below.

    > All resource names have to either:
    >
    > - Not conflict with existing resource names in the resource group for a new deployment, or
    > - Correspond to existing resources from a previous successful deployment.
    >
    > Re-using resources from a partial, unsuccessful deployment will likely fail. It is recommended to delete resources from those partial deployments.

    ```json
    [
        {
            "class": "mlos_bench.environments.azure.AzureVMService",

            "config": {
                "deployTemplatePath": "azure/arm-templates/azuredeploy-ubuntu-vm.jsonc",

                "subscription": "{{ ID of subscription to use }}",
                "resourceGroup": "{{ Name of resource group to use }}",
                "deploymentName": "{{ A deployment name to group all deployments under, e.g. redis-os-autotune-001 }}",
                "vmName": "{{ A VM name, e.g. redis-osat-vm }}",
            }
        }
    ]
    ```

5. Update your copy of `my-config/env-azure-ubuntu-redis.jsonc` and other config files with the details of your setup.
Please refer to inline comments in the corresponding `.jsonc` files for more information.

6. From here onwards we assume we are in the project root directory.
Ensure you have a conda environment (`mlos`) set up for executing `mlos_bench`.
Create and activate the environment with:

    ```sh
    conda env create -f conda-envs/mlos.yml
    conda activate mlos
    ```

7. Connect the [`Environment`](./mlos_bench/environments/), [`Service`](./mlos_bench/services/), [`Storage`](./mlos_bench/storage/), and [`Optimizer`](./mlos_bench/optimizers/) configurations in a top-level [JSON5](https://spec.json5.org) configuration - say, `config_bench.jsonc`:

    ```jsonc
    {
        "config_path": [                                 // Locations of config files and scripts
            "my-config",
            "mlos_bench/examples"
        ],

        "environment": "env-azure-ubuntu-redis.jsonc",   // Root config (location relative to config_path)

        "tunable_values": [                              // Key/value pairs of tunable parameters. Uses config_path
            "tunable-values-example.json"
        ],

        "globals": [                                     // Config generated at step 2. Uses config_path
            "global_config.json"
        ],

        "teardown": false,                               // Do not shutdown/deprovision a VM

        "log_file": "os-autotune.log",                   // Log file (also prints to stdout)
        "log_level": 10,                                 // Log level = DEBUG

        "experimentId": "RedisBench",                    // Experiment ID (can be in global_config.json)
        "trialId": 1                                     // Trial ID (can come from the persistent storage service)
    }
    ```

8. Run our configuration through `mlos_bench`:

    ```sh
    mlos_bench --config "config_bench.jsonc"
    ```

    This should run a single trial with the given tunable values, write teh results to the log and keep the environment running (as directed by the `"teardown": false` configuration parameter).

9. Check `os-autotune.log` to verify we get output corresponding to the command we remotely executed in the VM.

## Optimization

Searching for an optimal set of tunable parameters is very similar to running a single benchmark.
All we have to do is specifying the [`Storage`](./mlos_bench/storage/) and [`Optimizer`](./mlos_bench/optimizers/) in the top-level configuration, e.g.:

```jsonc
{
    "config_path": [                                 // Locations of config files and scripts
        "my-config",
        "mlos_bench/examples"
    ],

    "environment": "env-azure-ubuntu-redis.jsonc",   // Root config (location relative to config_path)
    "storage": "storage/sqlite.jsonc",               // Store data in a local SQLite3 file
    "optimizer": "optimizers/mlos_core_skopt.jsonc", // Use mlos_core/scikit optimizer

    "globals": [
        "global_config.json"                         // Config generated at step 2. Uses config_path
    ],

    "teardown": false,                               // Do not shutdown/deprovision a VM

    "log_file": "os-autotune.log",                   // Log file (also prints to stdout)
    "log_level": 10,                                 // Log level = DEBUG

    "experimentId": "RedisBench",                    // Experiment ID (can be in global_config.json)
    "trialId": 1                                     // Start ID of the trial
}
```

> **NOTE:** A working example of this configuration can be found in our repository at [azure-redis-skopt.jsonc](./mlos_bench/config/cli/azure-redis-skopt.jsonc).

The only difference between the two configurations is that the latter has the `optimizer` parameter instead of using a fixed set of tunables via `tunable_values` option.
It also stores the results of each trial in the SQLite3 database (configured via `storage`).

> Note that any config parameter (or even all of them) can be overridden by the corresponding command-line options, e.g.
>
> `mlos_bench --config "config_opt.jsonc" --log_level 20 --trialId 1000`

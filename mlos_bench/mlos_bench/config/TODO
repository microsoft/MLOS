# `config` Examples TODOs

- [ ] Add some of the global examples to a nightly CI/CD pipeline.

- [ ] Per discussion with Sergiy: try switching to putting each environment's tunables along with that environment's config and scripts so that they are somewhat self contained.
  - [ ] Need to double check that the composite env will still work this way (e.g. duplicate tunables across envs)

- [ ] improve handling of relative paths

- [ ] json schemas for config snippets?

## Laundry list of other items in this PR that need splitting

- [ ] support for returning default config in first iteration

- [ ] rename pluralization

- [ ] generalize which mlos core optimizer we return by default

- [ ] consolidation of pytest requirements to `setup.py` instead of conda envs

- [ ] adding more storage `extra_requires`

- [ ] rename include_tunables to include_tunable_values for the one shot optimizer config

- [ ] add support for loading tunables inside an optimizer

## Other random TODO ideas

- [ ] rename mlos_core conda envs to just mlos

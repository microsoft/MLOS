# `config` Examples TODOs

- [ ] Add some of the global examples to a nightly CI/CD pipeline.

- Per discussion with Sergiy: try switching to putting each environment's tunables along with that environment's config and scripts so that they are somewhat self contained.
  - Need to double check that the composite env will still work this way.

    A simple multi-process asynchronous optimization loop implementation.

    Notes
    -----
    This schedule uses :ext:py:class:`multiprocessing.Pool` to run
    :py:class:`~.Storage.Trial`s in parallel.

    To avoid issues with Python's forking implementation, which relies on pickling
    objects and functions from the main process and sending them to the child
    process to invoke, we need to avoid incompatible objects, which includes any
    additional threads (e.g., :py:mod:`asyncio` tasks such as
    :py:class:`mlos_bench.event_loop_context.EventLoopContext`), database
    connections (e.g., :py:mod:`mlos_bench.storage`), and file handles (e.g.,
    :ext:py:mod:`logging`) that are pickle incompatible.

    To accomplish this, we avoid entering the :py:class:`~.TrialRunner` context
    until we are in the child process and allow each child to manage its own
    incompatible resources via that context.

    Hence, each child process in the pool actually starts in functions in
    special handler functions in the :py:class:`~.ParallelScheduler` class that
    receive as inputs all the necessary (and picklable) info as arguments, then
    enter the given :py:class:`~.TrialRunner` instance context and invoke that
    procedure.

    For instance :py:meth:`~.ParallelScheduler._teardown_trial_runner` is a function that

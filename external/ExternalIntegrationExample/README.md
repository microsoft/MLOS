# ExternalIntegrationExample

[This directory](./#mlos-github-tree-view) serves as a minimal example for testing integration of MLOS with an external C++ example that uses `cmake` for its build system.

It generally does not depend on anything in the rest of the MLOS repo other than the `Mlos.Core` header files (both static and codegen outputs) and C# NuGet packages that the main MLOS build can produce.

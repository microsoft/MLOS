# ExternalIntegrationExample

This directory serves as a minimal example for testing integration of MLOS with an external C++ example.

It generally does not depend on anything in the rest of the MLOS repo other than the header files and C# NuGet packages that its build produces.

TODO: Extend this to work for a real example (e.g. LevelDB, MySQL, etc.)

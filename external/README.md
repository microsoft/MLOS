# External Integration Code and Examples

[This directory](./#mlos-github-tree-view) contains some code, configuration, and examples of how to integrate MLOS with external projects.

For instance:

- The [`cmake`](./cmake/) directory contains an `MLOS` module for use in projects using the `cmake` build system.
- [`ExternalIntegrationExample`](./ExternalIntegrationExample/) contains a stripped down example showing how to use it.
- [`leveldb`](./leveldb/) contains a notebook and other examples of using portions of the MLOS toolkit to tune [LevelDb](https://github.com/google/leveldb) parameters.

   Overview
   ++++++++

   MLOS is a framework for doing benchmarking and autotuning for systems.
   The bulk of the code to do that is written in python. As such, all of the code
   classes documented here take python objects in their construction.

   However, most users of MLOS will interact with the system via the ``mlos_bench`` CLI
   and its json config files and their own scripts for MLOS to invoke. This module
   attempts to document some of those high level interactions.

   General JSON Config Structure
   +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

   We use `json5 <https://pypi.org/project/json5/>`_ to parse the json files, since it
   allows for inline C style comments (e.g., ``//``, ``/* */``), trailing commas, etc.,
   so it is slightly more user friendly than strict json.

   By convention files use the ``*.mlos.json`` or ``*.mlos.jsonc`` extension to
   indicate that they are an ``mlos_bench`` config file.

   This allows tools that support `JSON Schema Store
   <https://www.schemastore.org/>`_ (e.g., `VSCode
   <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_ with an `extension
   <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=remcohaszing.schemastore>`_) to
   provide helpful autocomplete and validation of the json configs while editing.

   Organization
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Ultimately, each experiment is slightly different so it can take some time to get
   the automation right.

   Therefore the configs are intended to be modular and reusable to reduce the time to
   do that for the next set.
   Hence, they are usually split into several files and directory structures.

   We attempt to provide some examples and reusable templates in the core ``mlos_bench``
   package, but users are encouraged to create their own configs as needed, or to
   `submit PRs or Issues <https://github.com/microsoft/MLOS/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_ to add
   additional ones.

   References to some examples are provided below.

   Additional details about the organization of the files and directories are as follows:

   - ``cli/``:
       Contains the cli configs that control the overall setup for a set of Experiments.

   - ``environments/``:
       Contains the configs for :py:mod:`~mlos_bench.environments`, and their
       associated scripts (if relevant, e.g., for
       :py:class:`~mlos_bench.environments.remote.remote_env.RemoteEnv` or
       :py:class:`~mlos_bench.environments.script_env.ScriptEnv`) and
       :py:mod:`~mlos_bench.tunables`.

       There is usually one *root* environment that chains the others together to build
       a full experiment (e.g., via
       :py:class:`~mlos_bench.environments.composite_env.CompositeEnv` and the
       ``include_children`` field).
       The *root* environment is the one referenced in the CLI config ``environment``
       field.

       Note that each separate Environment config is really more of a template that
       allows for variable expansion so that the same environment can be used in
       multiple experiments with different configurations (see below).

       Similarly, Environments declare a need for a particular Service, but not which
       implementation of it.
       This allows for easy swapping of Services (e.g., a different cloud vendor) using
       a different ``services`` config in the CLI config.

       Grouping the scripts and tunables together with the environment allows for
       easier reuse, readability, and debugging.

       Note that tunables are also separated into "groups" each of which can be enabled
       for tuning or not, again controllable via ``globals`` variable expansion.

   - ``experiments/``:
       Contains some ``globals`` (variables) that help expand a set of other config
       templates out into a full set of configs.
       Since each experiment may only slightly differ from a previous one, this allows
       a greater reuse across individual experiments.

   - ``optimizers/``:
       Contains the configs for :py:mod:`mlos_bench.optimizers`.
       The optimizer is referenced in the CLI config's ``optimizer`` field.
       This config controls which optimizer to use and any custom settings for it.

   - ``services/``:
       Contains the configs for :py:mod:`mlos_bench.services`.

       In general services can simply be referenced in the CLI config's ``services``
       field, though sometimes additional settings are required, possibly provided by
       an additional ``globals`` config in the CLI config.

   - ``storage/``:
       Contains the configs for :py:mod:`mlos_bench.storage`.

       The storage config is referenced in the CLI config's ``storage`` field and
       controls how data is stored and retrieved for the experiments and trials.

   See below for additional details about each configuration type.

   CLI Configs
   ^^^^^^^^^^^

   :py:attr:`~.mlos_bench.config.schemas.config_schemas.ConfigSchema.CLI` style configs
   are typically used to start the ``mlos_bench`` CLI using the ``--config`` argument
   and a restricted key-value dict form where each key corresponds to a CLI argument.

   For instance:

   .. code-block:: json

      // cli-config.mlos.json
      {
        "experiment": "path/to/base/experiment-config.mlos.json",
        "services": [
          "path/to/some/service-config.mlos.json",
        ],
        "globals": "path/to/basic-globals-config.mlos.json",
      }

   .. code-block:: json

      // basic-globals-config.mlos.json
      {
        "location": "westus",
        "vm_size": "Standard_D2s_v5",
      }

   Typically CLI configs will reference some other configs, especially the base
   Environment and Services configs, but some ``globals`` may be left to be specified
   on the command line.

   For instance:

   .. code-block:: shell

      mlos_bench --config path/to/cli-config.mlos.json --globals experiment-config.mlos.json

   where ``experiment-config.mlos.json`` might look something like this:

   .. code-block:: json

      // experiment-config.mlos.json (also a set of globals)
      {
        "experiment_id": "my_experiment",
        "some_var": "some_value",
      }

   This allows some of the ``globals`` to be specified on the CLI to alter the behavior
   of a set of Experiments without having to adjust many of the other config files
   themselves.

   See below for examples.

   .. rubric:: Notes

   - See `mlos_bench CLI usage <../../../mlos_bench.run.usage.html>`_ for more details on the
     CLI arguments.
   - See `mlos_bench/config/cli
     <https://github.com/microsoft/MLOS/tree/main/mlos_bench/mlos_bench/config/cli>`_
     and `mlos_bench/tests/config/cli
     <https://github.com/microsoft/MLOS/tree/main/mlos_bench/mlos_bench/tests/config/cli>`_
     for some examples of CLI configs.

   Globals and Variable Substitution
   +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

   :py:attr:`Globals <mlos_bench.config.schemas.config_schemas.ConfigSchema.GLOBALS>`
   are basically just key-value variables that can be used in other configs using
   ``$variable`` substitution via the
   :py:meth:`~mlos_bench.dict_templater.DictTemplater.expand_vars` method.

   For instance:

   .. code-block:: json

      // globals-config.mlos.json
      {
        "experiment_id": "my_experiment",
        "some_var": "some_value",
        // environment variable expansion also works here
        "current_dir": "$PWD",
        "some_expanded_var": "$some_var: $experiment_id",
        "location": "eastus",

        // This can be specified in the CLI config or the globals config
        "tunable_params_map": {
           // a map of tunable_params variables to their covariant group names
           "environment1_tunables": [
               "covariant_group_name",
               "another_covariant_group_name"
           ],
           "environment2_tunables": [
               // empty list means no tunables
               // are enabled for this environment
               // during this experiment
               // (e.g., only use defaults for this environment)
           ],
      }

   Users can have multiple global config files, each specified with a ``--globals``
   CLI arg or ``"globals"`` CLI config property.

   At runtime, parameters from these files will be combined into a single
   dictionary, in the order they appear, and pushed to the root
   :py:class:`Environment <mlos_bench.environments>`.

   Any global or :py:class:`~.Environment` parameter can also be overridden from
   the command line, by simply specifying ``--PARAMETER_NAME PARAMETER_VALUE``.

   Another common use of global config files is to store sensitive data (e.g.,
   passwords, tokens, etc.) that should not be version-controlled.

   This way, users can keep their experiment-specific parameters separately from
   the Environment configs making them more reusable.

   There are additional details about `Variable Propagation
   <../environments/index.html#variable-propagation>`_ in the
   :py:mod:`mlos_bench.environments` module.

   Well Known Variables
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Here is a list of some well known variables that are provided or required by the
   system and may be used in the config files:

   - ``$experiment_id``: A unique identifier for the ``Experiment``.
       Typically provided in globals.
   - ``$trial_id``: A unique identifier for the ``Trial`` currently being executed.
       This can be useful in the configs for :py:mod:`mlos_bench.environments` for
       instance (e.g., when writing scripts).
   - ``$trial_runner_id``: A unique identifier for the ``TrialRunner``.
       This can be useful when running multiple trials in parallel (e.g., to
       provision a numbered VM per worker).
   - ``$tunable_params_map``: A map of ``tunable_params`` ``$name`` to their list of covariant group names.
       This is usually used in a CLI ``--config`` CLI config or ``--globals``
       (e.g., "experiment") config file and is used to control what the
       ``"tunable_params": $tunable_group_name`` specified in the the
       :py:mod:`mlos_bench.environments` JSONC configs resolves to.
       This can be used to control which tunables are enabled for tuning for an
       experiment without having to change the underlying Environment config.

   Tunable Configs
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   There are two forms of tunable configs:

   - "TunableParams"  style configs

       Which are used to define the set of
       :py:mod:`~mlos_bench.tunables.tunable_groups.TunableGroups` (i.e., tunable
       parameters).

       .. code-block:: json

          // some-env-tunables.json
          {
            // a group of tunables that are tuned together
            "covariant_group_name": [
              {
                "name": "tunable_name",
                "type": "int",
                "range": [0, 100],
                "default": 50,
              },
              // more tunables
            ],
            // another group of tunables
            // both can be enabled at the same time
            "another_group_name": [
              {
                "name": "another_tunable_name",
                "type": "categorical",
                "values": ["red", "yellow", "green"],
                "default": "green"
              },
              // more tunables
            ],
          }

     Since TunableParams are associated with an :py:mod:`~mlos_bench.environments`,
     they are typically kept in the same directory as that Environment's config and
     named something like ``env-tunables.json``.

   - "TunableValues" style configs which are used to specify the values for an
     instantiation of a set of tunables params.

     These are essentially just a dict of the tunable names and their values.
     For instance:

       .. code-block:: json

          // tunable-values.mlos.json
          {
             "tunable_name": 25,
             "another_tunable_name": "red",
          }

     These can be used with the
     :py:class:`~mlos_bench.optimizers.one_shot_optimizer.OneShotOptimizer`
     :py:class:`~mlos_bench.optimizers.manual_optimizer.ManualOptimizer` to run a
     benchmark with a particular config or set of configs.

   For more information on tunable configs, see the :py:mod:`mlos_bench.tunables`
   module.

   Class Configs
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   Class style configs include most anything else and roughly take this form:

   .. code-block:: json

      // class configs (environments, services, etc.)
      {
         // some mlos class name to load
         "class": "mlos_bench.type.ClassName",
         "config": {
           // class specific config
           "key": "value",
           "key2": "$some_var",    // variable substitution is allowed here too
         }
      }

   Where ``type`` is one of the core classes in the system:

   - :py:mod:`~mlos_bench.environments`
   - :py:mod:`~mlos_bench.optimizers`
   - :py:mod:`~mlos_bench.services`
   - :py:mod:`~mlos_bench.schedulers`
   - :py:mod:`~mlos_bench.storage`

   Each of which have their own submodules and classes that dictate the allowed and
   expected structure of the ``config`` section.

   In certain cases (e.g., script command execution) the variable substitution rules
   take on slightly different behavior
   See various documentation in :py:mod:`mlos_bench.environments` for more details.

   Config Processing
   +++++++++++++++++

   Config files are processed by the :py:class:`~mlos_bench.launcher.Launcher` and
   :py:class:`~mlos_bench.services.config_persistence.ConfigPersistenceService` classes
   at startup time by the ``mlos_bench`` CLI.

   The typical entrypoint is a CLI config which references other configs, especially
   the base Environment config, Services, Optimizer, and Storage.

   See `mlos_bench CLI usage <../../../mlos_bench.run.usage.html>`__ for more details
   on those arguments.

   Schema Definitions
   ++++++++++++++++++

   For further details on the schema definitions and validation, see the
   :py:class:`~mlos_bench.config.schemas.config_schemas.ConfigSchema` class
   documentation, which also contains links to the actual schema definitions in the
   source tree (see below).

   Debugging
   +++++++++

   Most of the time issues in running an Experiment involve issues with the json
   configs and/or user scripts that are being run by the framework.

   It can help to run ``mlos_bench`` with ``--log-level DEBUG`` to see more detailed
   output about the steps it is taking.
   Alternatively, it can help to add additional debug logging to the user scripts
   themselves to see what about the unique automation process is failing.

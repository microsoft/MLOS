   Bases: :py:obj:`mlos_bench.environments.local.local_env.LocalEnv`


   Scheduler-side Environment that runs scripts locally and uploads/downloads data
   to the shared file storage.

   Create a new application environment with a given config.

   :param name: Human-readable name of the environment.
   :type name: str
   :param config: Free-format dictionary that contains the benchmark environment
                  configuration. Each config must have at least the "tunable_params"
                  and the "const_args" sections.
                  `LocalFileShareEnv` must also have at least some of the following
                  parameters: {setup, upload, run, download, teardown,
                  dump_params_file, read_results_file}
   :type config: dict
   :param global_config: Free-format dictionary of global parameters (e.g., security credentials)
                         to be mixed in into the "const_args" section of the local config.
   :type global_config: dict
   :param tunables: A collection of tunable parameters for *all* environments.
   :type tunables: TunableGroups
   :param service: An optional service object (e.g., providing methods to
                   deploy or reboot a VM, etc.).
   :type service: Service


   .. py:method:: run() -> tuple[mlos_bench.environments.status.Status, datetime.datetime, dict[str, mlos_bench.tunables.tunable_types.TunableValue] | None]

      Download benchmark results from the shared storage and run post-processing
      scripts locally.

      :returns: **(status, timestamp, output)** -- 3-tuple of (Status, timestamp, output) values, where `output` is a dict
                with the results or None if the status is not COMPLETED.
                If run script is a benchmark, then the score is usually expected to
                be in the `score` field.
      :rtype: (Status, datetime.datetime, dict)



   .. py:method:: setup(tunables: mlos_bench.tunables.tunable_groups.TunableGroups, global_config: dict | None = None) -> bool

      Run setup scripts locally and upload the scripts and data to the shared storage.

      :param tunables: A collection of tunable OS and application parameters along with their
                       values. In a local environment these could be used to prepare a config
                       file on the scheduler prior to transferring it to the remote environment,
                       for instance.
      :type tunables: TunableGroups
      :param global_config: Free-format dictionary of global parameters of the environment
                            that are not used in the optimization process.
      :type global_config: dict

      :returns: **is_success** -- True if operation is successful, false otherwise.
      :rtype: bool



   .. py:method:: status() -> tuple[mlos_bench.environments.status.Status, datetime.datetime, list[tuple[datetime.datetime, str, Any]]]

      Check the status of the benchmark environment.

      :returns: **(benchmark_status, timestamp, telemetry)** -- 3-tuple of (benchmark status, timestamp, telemetry) values.
                `timestamp` is UTC time stamp of the status; it's current time by default.
                `telemetry` is a list (maybe empty) of (timestamp, metric, value) triplets.
      :rtype: (Status, datetime.datetime, list)

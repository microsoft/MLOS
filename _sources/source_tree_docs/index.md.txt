## Overview

MLOS currently focuses on an *offline* tuning approach, though we intend to add online tuning in the future.

To accomplish this, the general flow involves

- Running a workload (i.e., benchmark) against a system (e.g., a database, web server, or key-value store).
- Retrieving the results of that benchmark, and perhaps some other metrics from the system.
- Feed that data to an optimizer (e.g., using [Bayesian Optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_optimization) or other techniques).
- Obtain a new suggested config to try from the optimizer.
- Apply that configuration to the target system.
- Repeat until either the exploration budget is consumed or the configurations' performance appear to have converged.

## Organization

To do this this repo provides three Python modules, which can be used independently or in combination:

- [`mlos-bench`](https://github.com/microsoft/MLOS/tree/main/././mlos_bench/) provides a framework to help automate running benchmarks as described above.

- [`mlos-viz`](https://github.com/microsoft/MLOS/tree/main/././mlos_viz/) provides some simple APIs to help automate visualizing the results of benchmark experiments and their trials.

  It provides a simple `plot(experiment_data)` API, where `experiment_data` is obtained from the `mlos_bench.storage` module.

- [`mlos-core`](https://github.com/microsoft/MLOS/tree/main/././mlos_core/) provides an abstraction around existing optimization frameworks (e.g., [FLAML](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML), [SMAC](https://github.com/automl/SMAC3), etc.)

  It is intended to provide a simple, easy to consume (e.g. via `pip`), with low dependencies abstraction to

  - describe a space of context, parameters, their ranges, constraints, etc. and result objectives
  - an "optimizer" service [abstraction](https://microsoft.github.io/MLOS/source_tree_docs/index.html) (e.g. [`register()`](https://microsoft.github.io/MLOS/autoapi/mlos_bench/optimizers/base_optimizer/index.html#mlos_bench.optimizers.base_optimizer.Optimizer.register) and [`suggest()`](https://microsoft.github.io/MLOS/autoapi/mlos_bench/optimizers/base_optimizer/index.html#mlos_bench.optimizers.base_optimizer.Optimizer.suggest)) so we can easily swap out different implementations methods of searching (e.g. random, BO, LLM, etc.)
  - provide some helpers for [automating optimization experiment](https://microsoft.github.io/MLOS/source_tree_docs/mlos_bench/index.html) runner loops and data collection

For these design requirements we intend to reuse as much from existing OSS libraries as possible and layer policies and optimizations specifically geared towards autotuning systems over top.

By providing wrappers we aim to also allow more easily experimenting with replacing underlying optimizer components as new techniques become available or seem to be a better match for certain systems.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/microsoft/MLOS/tree/main/././CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on development environment and contributing.

## Getting Started

The development environment for MLOS uses [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) and [`devcontainers`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) to ease dependency management, but not all these libraries are required for deployment.

For instructions on setting up the development environment please try one of the following options:

- see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/microsoft/MLOS/tree/main/././CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on setting up a local development environment
- launch this repository (or your fork) in a [codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces), or
- have a look at one of the autotuning example repositories like [sqlite-autotuning](https://github.com/Microsoft-CISL/sqlite-autotuning) to kick the tires in a [codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces) in your browser immediately :)

### `conda` activation

1. Create the `mlos` Conda environment.

   ```sh
   conda env create -f conda-envs/mlos.yml
   ```

   > See the [`conda-envs/`](https://github.com/microsoft/MLOS/tree/main/././conda-envs/) directory for additional conda environment files, including those used for Windows (e.g. [`mlos-windows.yml`](https://github.com/microsoft/MLOS/tree/main/././conda-envs/mlos-windows.yml)).

   or

   ```sh
   # This will also ensure the environment is update to date using "conda env update -f conda-envs/mlos.yml"
   make conda-env
   ```

   > Note: the latter expects a \*nix environment.

1. Initialize the shell environment.

   ```sh
   conda activate mlos
   ```

### Usage Examples

#### `mlos-core`

For an example of using the `mlos_core` optimizer APIs run the [`BayesianOptimization.ipynb`](https://github.com/microsoft/MLOS/tree/main/././mlos_core/notebooks/BayesianOptimization.ipynb) notebook.

#### `mlos-bench`

For an example of using the `mlos_bench` tool to run an experiment, see the [`mlos_bench` Quickstart README](https://github.com/microsoft/MLOS/tree/main/././mlos_bench/README.md#quickstart).

Here's a quick summary:

```shell
./scripts/generate-azure-credentials-config > global_config_azure.jsonc

# run a simple experiment
mlos_bench --config ./mlos_bench/mlos_bench/config/cli/azure-redis-1shot.jsonc
```

- [mlos_bench/config](https://github.com/microsoft/MLOS/tree/main/././mlos_bench/mlos_bench/config/) for additional configuration details.
- [sqlite-autotuning](https://github.com/Microsoft-CISL/sqlite-autotuning) for a complete external example of using MLOS to tune `sqlite`.

#### `mlos-viz`

For a simple example of using the `mlos_viz` module to visualize the results of an experiment, see the [`sqlite-autotuning`](https://github.com/Microsoft-CISL/sqlite-autotuning) repository, especially the [mlos_demo_sqlite_teachers.ipynb](https://github.com/Microsoft-CISL/sqlite-autotuning/blob/main/mlos_demo_sqlite_teachers.ipynb) notebook.

These can be used as starting points for new autotuning projects outside of the main MLOS repository if you want to keep your tuning experiment configs separate from the MLOS codebase.

Alternatively, we accept PRs to add new examples to the main MLOS repository!

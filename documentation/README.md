# MLOS Documentation

This directory contains project wide documentation for things like coding standards, overall architecture descriptions, build instructions, etc.

Individual components may also include their own more detailed documentation within their subdirectories.

> Note: Some documentation uses [Mermaid](https://mermaidjs.github.io/#/) for diagrams in addition to [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/). \
> You can install [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/#/) for [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Visual Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to help render it more easily.

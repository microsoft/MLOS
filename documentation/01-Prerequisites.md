MLOS currently supports 64-bit Intel/AMD platforms, though ARM64 support is under development.
It supports Windows and Linux environments. Below we provide instructions for each OS.

## Linux

On Linux, there are a couple of options to install the build tools and the needed Python environment.
The preferred way is via the [Docker images](#option-1-linux-docker-build).
All of them require `git` and, of course, a Linux installation:

### Linux Distribution Requirements

- Ubuntu 16.04 (xenial), 18.04 (bionic), 20.04 (focal)

> Other distros/versions may work, but are untested.

### Clone the repository

Make sure you have `git` available:

```sh
apt-get -y install git
```

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/MLOS.git
cd MLOS
```

### Option 1: Linux Docker Build Env

#### Install Docker

Docker is used for certain portions of the end-to-end examples and as a convient way to setup the build/dev/test environments.

> If you are starting with the [Python only setup](#install-python-on-linux), you can skip this step for now if you wish.

Please see the official Docker install documenation for distribution specific documentation. The Ubuntu docs are [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).

#### Build the Docker Image

To automatically setup a Linux build environment using `docker`, run the following to build the image locally:

```sh
# Build the docker image:
docker build --build-arg=UbuntuVersion=20.04 -t mlos/build:ubuntu-20.04 .
```

> Where `20.04` can also be replaced with another [supported `UbuntuVersion`](#linux-distribution-requirements).

See [02-Build.md](./02-Build.md#docker) for instructions on how to run this image.

### Option 2: Manual Build Tools Install

To manually setup your own Linux build environment:

```sh
# Make sure some basic build tools are available:
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

```sh
# Make sure some apt related tools are available:
sudo apt-get install \
  apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gnupg-agent software-properties-common

# Make sure an appropriate version of clang is available:
./scripts/install.llvm-clang.sh
```

```sh
# Make sure some dotnet dependencies are available:
sudo apt-get install liblttng-ctl0 liblttng-ust0 zlib1g libxml2
```

> Note: older distros such as Ubuntu 16.04 may also need the `libcurl3` package installed for `dotnet restore` to work, but is unavailable on (or will break) more recent versions of Ubuntu.
>
> Note: `libxml2` pulls an appropriate version of `libicu`.
>
> Note: most other dependencies like `dotnet` and `cmake` are automatically fetched to the `tools/` directory using helpers in `scripts/` and invoked by the `Makefile` and `cmake` tools.

Optional tools:

```sh
sudo apt-get install exuberant-ctags
```

> When available `make ctags` can be invoked to help generate a `tags` database at the root of the source tree to allow easier code navigation in editors that support it.

### Install Python on Linux

#### Option 1: Docker Python Install

If you used the [Docker build image](#docker-build-image) instructions you're done!  All of the required packages should already be installed in the image.

#### Option 2: Using Conda

TODO

#### Option 3: Manual Python Install

1. Install Python 3.7

    ```sh
    # We need to add a special apt repository for Python 3.7 support:
    sudo apt-get -y install \
        software-properties-common apt-transport-https
    sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get -y install python3.7
    ```

2. Install MLOS Python dependencies:

    ```sh
    # Also add some dependencies needed by some of the pip modules
    sudo apt-get -y install python3-pip python3.7-dev \
        build-essential libfreetype-dev unixodbc-dev
    ```

    ```sh
    python3.7 -m pip install --upgrade pip
    python3.7 -m pip install setuptools

    python3.7 -m pip install \
        -r source/Mlos.Python/requirements.txt
    ```

## Windows

MLOS is easiest to use on Windows 10, Version 1903 (March 2019) or newer.

### Step 1: Clone the repository

[Install git](https://git-scm.com/) and clone the repo:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/MLOS.git
cd MLOS
```

### Step 2: Install Python

TODO

### Step 3: Install Docker on Windows

Portions of MLOS use Docker. Please follow the instructions on the [Docker Website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) to install it. Note that on Windows *Home*, you need a fairly recent Windows version to install Docker (Windows 10 1903 or newer).

On Windows 10 v1903 or newer, we recommend you use the [Windows Subsytem for Linux v2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#update-to-wsl-2) to run the containers. On older Windows 10, you can resort to the [Hyper-V support](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/) of Docker.

### Step 4: Install Windows Build Tools

Download and install Visual Studio 2019 (free) Community Edition:

<https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/>

Be sure to include support for .Net Core and C++.

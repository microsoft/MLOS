# increment the .patch portion of the versions it produces and calculate the number of commits since
# branch for the SemVers .{branchName}+{commits} suffix.
# So, to do releases in this way, from time to time we need to decide that certain commits should be
# tagged with a new v{major.minor.0} version.

# Python language file instructions

- Include instructions from [default.instructions.md](default.instructions.md) for all languages.

- All functions, methods, classes, and attributes should have docstrings.

- Docstrings should include Sphinx style crossref directives for functions, methods, classes, attributes, and data whenever possible using `:py:class:` or `:py:func:` or `:py:meth:` or `:py:attr:` or `:py:data` syntax, respectively,

  See Also <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/domains/python.html#python-xref-roles>

- Docstrings for modules should include a summary of the module's purpose and any important details about its usage.

  - Module docstrings should also include an executable example of how to use the module, including any important functions or classes or configuration options (especially those derived from a JSON config file) like any of those in `mlos_bench.environments`, `mlos_bench.services`, `mlos_bench.schedulers`, `mlos_bench.optimizers`, and `mlos_bench.storage`.

    For instance:

    ```python
    '''
    This is an example module docstring for the mlos_bench.environments.my_special_env module.

    It should include some descriptive text about the module and its purpose.

    Example
    -------
    It also includes some executable code examples.

    >>> import json5 as json
    >>> # Load a JSON config string for a MySpecialEnvironment instance.
    >>> json_string = """
    ... {
    ...     "class": "mlos_bench.environments.my_special_env.MySpecialEnvironment",
    ...     "name": "MySpecialEnvironment",
    ...     "config": {
    ...             "param1": 42,
    ...             "param2": "foo",
    ...     },
    ... }
    ... """
    >>> config = json.loads(json_string)

    >>> from mlos_bench.environments.my_special_env import MySpecialEnvironment
    >>> my_env = MySpecialEnvironment(config=config)
    >>> print(my_env)
    MySpecialEnvironment(param1=42, param2='foo')
    '''
    ```

  - Docstrings for classes can refer to their module docstring with `:py:mod:` cross-references for usage examples to allow easier browser navigation of generated documentation.

    For instance:

    ```python
    class MySpecialEnv:
        """
        This is class docstring for MySpecialEnv.

        It should include some descriptive text about the class and its purpose.

        Example
        -------
        Refer to :py:mod:`mlos_bench.environments.my_special_env` for usage examples.
        """
    ```

- If not all arguments to a function or method fit on the same line, then they should each be on their own line.

  Adding a trailing comma to the last argument is optional, but recommended for consistency whenever a single line is insufficient.

- Code should be formatting using `black`.

- Code should be type checked using `mypy`.

  - All function and method parameters should be type annotated.

- Code should be linted using `pylint`.

- Tests should be included for all new code and should be run using `pytest`.

- Tests should be organized roughly the same way as the code they are testing (e.g., `tests/some/test_module.py` for `some/module.py`).

- Test fixtures that setup the resources for the tests (e.g., Environments, Services, Storage, Optimizer, Scheduler, etc.) should be included in a `conftest.py` file in the same directory as the tests or else a `fixtures.py` file in the same directory as the tests.
